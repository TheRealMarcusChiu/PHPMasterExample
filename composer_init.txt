A. create basic composer.json file in current directory
     composer init

B. Install the dependencies by running composer’s install command
     composer install             installs both composer's require and require-dev
     composer install —no-dev     installs only composer's require

     this would create a vendor directory in your project with the required libraries and an auto loader used to load them into the project.

C. Require composers auto loader in to your PHP script with
     require ‘/path/to/sdk/vendor/autoload.php’;

D. optional - Updating packages
     composer update              updates both composer's require and require-dev
     composer update —no-dev      updates only composer's require
